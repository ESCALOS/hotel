Inspired by a minimalist countryside and displaying the naturalness of its materials, the Casa de Marlon y Karina offers a spacious, quiet and fresh habitat, surrounded by vegetation bordering the La Escalera mountain range natural conservation area. The melodious sound of birds, the wind moving the branches of the trees and the sound of frogs at dusk accompanies the well-deserved rest after an intense day. Just eight minutes from the city center, the Casa de Marlon y Karina offers you the place where you can feel the nature of our high jungle without entering its thickness and having any service at hand. With five spacious rooms, a quiet and cozy garden, a large living room, dining room and kitchen that you can use, you will feel as comfortable as at home.
